        <p>I go Down to the shore<br /></p>

        <p>I go down to the shore in the morning<br />
          and depending on the hour the waves<br />
          are rolling in or moving out,<br />
          and I say, oh, I am miserable,<br />
          what shall— <br />
          what should I do? And the sea says <br />
          in its lovely voice:<br />
          Excuse me, I have work to do.<br /></p>

      <p>The Gardener<br /></p>

      <p>Have I lived enough?<br />
      Have I loved enough?<br />
      Have I considered Right Action enough, have I<br />
        come to any conclusion?<br />
      Have I experienced happiness with sufficient gratitude?<br />
      Have I endured loneliness with grace?<br /></p>

      <p>I say this, or perhaps I’m just thinking it.
        Actually, I probably think too much.<br /></p>

      <p>Then I step out into the garden,
      where the gardener, who is said to be a simple man,
        is tending his children, the roses.<br /></p>

      <p>Today<br /></p>

      <p>Today I’m flying low and I’m<br />
      not saying a word.<br />
      I’m letting all the voodoos of ambition sleep.<br /></p>

      <p>The world goes on as it must,<br />
      the bees in the garden rumbling a little,<br />
      the fish leaping, the gnats getting eaten.<br />
      And so forth.</p>

      <p>But I’m taking the day off.<br />
      Quiet as a feather.<br />
      I hardly move though really I’m travelling<br />
      a terrific distance.</p>

      <p>Stillness. One of the doors<br />
      into the temple.</p>

      <p>I have decided</p>

      <p>I have decided to find myself a home<br />
      in the mountains, somewhere high up<br />
      where one learns to live peacefully in<br />
      the cold and the silence. It’s said that<br />
      in such a place certain revelations may<br />
      be discovered. That what the spirit<br />
      reaches for may be eventually felt, if not<br />
      exactly understood. Slowly, no doubt. I’m<br />
      not talking about a vacation.</p>

      <p>Of course at the same time I mean to<br />
      stay exactly where I am.</p>

      <p>Are you following me?</p>

      <p>The poet compares human nature<br />
      to the ocean from which we came</p>

      <p>The sea can do craziness, it can do smooth,<br />
      it can lie down like silk breathing<br />
      or toss havoc shoreward; it can give</p>

      <p>Gifts or withhold it all; it can rise, ebb, froth<br />
      like an incoming frenzy of fountains, or it can<br />
      sweet-talk entirely. As I can too,</p>

      <p>and so, no doubt, can you, and you.</p>

      <p>The man who has many answers</p>

      <p>The man who has many answers<br />
      is often found<br />
      in the theaters of information<br />
      where he offers, graciously,<br />
      his deep findings.</p>

      <p>While the man who has only questions,<br />
      to comfort himself, makes music.</p>
