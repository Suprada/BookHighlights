				First and foremost, it reminds us that we <em>are</em> alive and that it is a gift and a privilege, not a right. We must earn life once it has been awarded us. Life asks for rewards back because it has favored us with animation.

				Read poetry everyday of your life. Poetry is good because it flexes muscles you don't use often enough. Poetry expands the senses and keeps them in prime condition. It keeps you aware of your nose, your eye, your ear, your tongue, your hand. And, above all, poetry is compacted metaphor or simile.**

				Why all this insistence on the senses? Because in order to convince your reader that he is <em>there</em>, you must assault each one of his senses, in turn with color, sound, taste, and texture.

				The men change, but one thing remains always the same: the fever, the ardor, the delight. Because I wanted to do, I did. Where I wanted to feed, I fed. I remember wandering, stunned, off a stage in my home town, holding a live rabbit given to me by Blackstone the Magician in the greatest performance ever! I remember, wandering, stunned, in the papier-mache streets of the Century of Progress Exhibition in Chicago in 1953; in the halls of the Venetian doges in Italy in 1954. The quality of each event was immensely different, but my ability to drink it in, the same.

				To feed your Muse, then, you should always have been hungry about life since you were a child. If not, it is a little late to start. Better late than never, of course. Do you feel up to it? 

				It means you must take long walks at night around your city or town, or walks in the country by day. And long walks any time, through bookstores and libraries.

				To feed well is to grow. To work well and constantly is to keep what you have learned and know in prime condition. Experience. Labor. These are the twin sides of the coin which when spun is neither experience nor labor, but the moment of revelation.

				But how did I begin? Starting in Mr. Electrico's year, I wrote a thousand words a day. For ten years, I wrote at least one short story a week, somehow guessing that a day would finally come when I truly got out of the way and let it happen.

				It was with great relief, then, that in my early twenties I floundered into a word-association process in which I simply got out of bed every morning, walked to my desk, and put down any word or series of words that happened along in my head.
				I would then take arms against that word, or for it, and bring on an assortment of characters to weigh the word and show me its meaning in my own life. An hour or two hours later, to my amazement, a new story would be finished and done. The surprise was total and lovely. I soon found that I would have to work this way for the rest of my life.

				Fantasy, even when it takes science-fictional forms, which it often does, is dangerous. It is escapist. It is day-dreaming. It has nothing to do with the world and the world's problems.
				So said the snobs who did not know themselves as snobs.

				The kids sensed, if they could not speak it, that the first science-fiction writers were cavemen who were trying to figure out the first sciences - which were what? How to capture fire. What to do to that lout of a mammoth hanging around outside the cave. How to play dentist to the sabre-tooth tiger and turn him into a house-cat.

				The children sensed, if they could not speak, that the entire history of mankind is problem solving, or science fiction swallowing ideas, digesting them, and excreting formulas for survival. You can't have one without the other. No fantasy, no reality. No studies conncerning loss, no gain. No imagination, no will. No impossible dreams: No possible solutions.

				That Truth again: the History of Ideas, which is all that science fiction has ever been. Ideas birthing themselves into fact, dying, only to reinvent new dreams and ideas to be reborn in yet more fascinating shapes and forms, some of them permanent, all of them promising Survival.

				"Go, children. Run and read. Read and run. Show and tell. Spin another pyramid on its nose. Turn another world upside-down. Knock the soot off my brain. Repaint the Sistine Chapel inside my skull. Laugh and think. Dream and learn and build."
				"Run, boys! Run, girls! Run!"
				And with such good advice, the kids will run.
				And the Republic will be saved.

				We all are rich and ignore the buried fact of accumulated wisdom.
